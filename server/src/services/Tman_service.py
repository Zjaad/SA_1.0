        As Tman (Time Management AI), create an optimized study schedule considering:

        Student Profile:
        - Level: {student_data.get('education_level')}
        - Available Time: {json.dumps(available_time)}
        - Subjects: {', '.join(subjects)}
        
        Requirements:
        1. Subject Prioritization
           - Analyze subject difficulty
           - Consider upcoming exams/deadlines
           
        2. Time Optimization
           - Peak performance hours
           - Energy level management
           - Strategic break placement
           
        3. Study Methods Integration
           - Pomodoro technique
           - 80/20 principle for key topics
           - Spaced repetition scheduling
           
        Provide 3 schedule options with:
        - Daily breakdown
        - Study method recommendations
        - Break scheduling
        - Expected outcomes
